# compvisionASL

The code in this repository was my Computer Vision American Sign Language submission for First Year Engineering Design. 

"test.py" - code used to run project
"algorithm.py" - sourced from Google's Teachable Machine; used "keras_model.h5" for algorithm, which was trained on ~15,000 custom images 
"dataCollection.py" - used to collect dataset by splicing and collecting frames
labels.txt - list of labels that may be identified through classification algorithm
